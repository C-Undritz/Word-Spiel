># **OVERVIEW**
This is a Wordle clone through and through!  I have never actually played Wordle but after learning about the game I was telling everyone that the game would be simple to code so I thought I had better put my money where my mouth is!  This project uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to power a responsive web front-end and Flask to power the back end with the game logic written in Python.  Two API's are also used.  

Like actual Wordle, the player is asked to guess a word by typing in a word and the game returns hints against the guess to guide the player to the word to guess.  As long as the player guesses the word within the set number of rounds then they win the game!

## APIs
Used [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/hub) to access the APIs used below:

- [WordsAPI](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/): Used to check the validity of the word entered by the player.
- [Random Words](https://rapidapi.com/sheharyar566/api/random-words5/): Used to generate a new word each game.
